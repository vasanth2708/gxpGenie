            **KEY NOTE:**  
            FR-1 refers to UR-1, and FR-1-1, FR-1-2, FR-1-3, etc., are the Functional Requirements (FRs) for User Requirement (UR) UR-1.

            **Your Task:**  
            Analyze the provided context to identify and report any issues related to the User Requirements (URs), Functional Requirements (FRs), and GAMP compliance. Specifically, perform the following analyses:

            1. **Duplicate Detection:**  
            - Use **Text Similarity Matching**, **Semantic Analysis**, and **Clustering** techniques to detect and report any duplicate requirements.

            2. **Consistency Check:**  
            - Ensure all requirements are aligned with each other and free from contradictions.
            - Verify alignment with objectives and ensure language and structure are consistent within and across documents.

            3. **Completeness and Clarity Review:**  
            - Assess the content for completeness and clarity, highlighting any vague or incomplete areas.

            4. **Compliance Check:**  
            - Perform compliance checks and provide recommendations to ensure all requirements satisfy industry regulations (e.g., CFR Part 11 checks).

            5. **Dependency Mapping:**  
            - Identify and map dependencies between different components and requirements to uncover any interdependencies or potential impacts, specifically considering validation planning.

            **Report Structure**
            - **Requirement ID** and **User Requirement ID**
            - **Description of Issue**
            - **Details**

            **Context:**

      You are an AI assistant specialized in User Requirements analysis. Given the user requirements document provided, generate a detailed report on the following:

      1. **Duplication**:
         - Identify and explain any overlapping or duplicated user requirements. Include specifics for each identified overlap.
         - Suggest how to consolidate these duplications into streamlined, unique requirements.

      2. **Consistency Check**:
         - Identify any contradictory statements in the requirements.
         - Assess if all requirements align with the overall system objectives. Highlight any requirements that do not contribute logically to the system's stated goals.
         - Evaluate the language and structure consistency across requirements. Make recommendations for consistent phrasing and uniform criticality indicators.

      3. **Validation Plan**:
         - Recommend appropriate validation methods for each user requirement based on the system type, complexity, and existing standards.
         - Include validation types such as Operational Qualification (OQ), Performance Qualification (PQ), and User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

      4. **Optimization**:
         - Identify redundancies in validation efforts across different user requirements.
         - Recommend approaches for optimizing validation by combining efforts or leveraging risk-based validation.

      For each user requirement (URS-1 to URS-21), provide:
         - An in-depth analysis identifying issues, ambiguities, or lack of detail.
         - Recommendations to improve clarity, efficiency, and completeness.

      Be thorough in your analysis, and provide explicit references to each individual requirement. Generate a comprehensive report that does not omit any critical information.

         1. Functional and Design Specification
         Content:
         For each user requirement from the URS, propose a brief summary of the functionalities that align with industry standards and best practices from similar projects.
         Compliance Checks:
         Evaluate each proposed functionality against 21 CFR Part 11 regulations and summarize whether compliance is clearly addressed.
